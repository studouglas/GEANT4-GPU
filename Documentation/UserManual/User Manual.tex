\section{Installation} % Victor
\subsection{Required Hardware} % Victor
In order to successfully install and run GEANT4 with GPU parallelism, you must first check that the workstation that you are installing on has a NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 3.0 or higher.\\
To check if the GPU on your current workstation supports CUDA with a Compute Capability of 3.0 or higher, perform the following actions:\\ \\
%Commented out pending a successful windows installation
%Windows:\\
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Determine the graphics card that is currently installed.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Simply right-click on your desktop.
%\item Look for any item in the drop down that says "NVIDIA Control Panel" or "NVIDIA Display" 
%\item Click whichever of the two options you see in order to check the name of your card.
%\end{enumerate}
%\item Visit https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus and find your GPU to determine the Compute Capability of your card. 
%\item Ensure that the Compute Capability is 3.0 or higher.
%\end{enumerate}

Redhat:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the graphics card that is currently installed.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open a shell
\item Enter the following command lspci | grep -i nvidia
\item You should see output similar to the following:\\
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK104GL [Quadro K5000] (rev a1)
\item Where [Quadro K5000] is the name of your NVIDIA Graphics Card
\end{enumerate}
\item Visit \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus}{NVIDIA} and find your GPU to determine the Compute Capability of your card.
\item Check to ensure that you have a NVIDIA GPU with a  Compute Capability of at least 3.0.
\item If you can't find the currently installed GPU on the list, it is not CUDA compatible.
\end{enumerate}

OS X 10.11 (El Capitan):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the graphics card that is currently installed.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click on the blue apple icon in the top left-hand corner of your screen.
\item Click on About This Mac.
\item Click on More Info...
\item Under Contents click Hardware to view it's options.
\item Click on Graphics/Displays.
\item You should see the name of your card at the top of the right view-pane.
\end{enumerate}
\item Visit \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus}{NVIDIA} and find your GPU to determine the Compute Capability of your card.
\item Check to ensure that you have a NVIDIA GPU with a  Compute Capability of at least 3.0.
\item If you can't find the currently installed GPU on the list, it is not CUDA compatible.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Required Software} % Victor


\subsection{Supported Operating Systems} % Victor
Currently, the only operating systems GEANT4-GPU has been tested on are OS X 10.11 and  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.7 (Santiago). Other versions of these operating systems are likely to work, but compatibility is not guaranteed.\\
To check what version of OS X you have, perform the following actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click on the blue apple icon in the top left-hand corner of your screen.
\item Click on About This Mac.
\item Check to ensure that the version of your OS is 10.11 (El Capitan) (earlier versions may work, but are not guaranteed).
\end{enumerate}
To check your version of RHEl, perform the following actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open a shell.
\item Type in the following command "cat /etc/redhat-release" or "uname -m \&\& cat /etc/*release"
\item Check to ensure that the version of RHEL installed is 6.7 (Santiago) (earlier versions may work, but are not guaranteed).

\subsection{Installation} % Matt
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure path names are correct, check for spaces in pathnames
\item The DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX in step 4 of installing GEANT-4  has two paths. Make sure they are separated by a space.
\item make sure your operating system is supported 
\item Newer versions of Clang (included with Xcode 7) have been know to cause problems. Download Xcode 6 and uninstall Xcode 7 if this is the case.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Running the Simulation} % Matt 
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that your graphics card is a NVidia card with Compute Capability 3.0.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{FAQ} % Matt
\textbf{What is GEANT-4?}\\
Many physics researchers use GEANT-4 to learn about how particles interact with a specific environment. It is a toolkit (i.e. library) that uses the Monte Carlo model, meaning each particle's properties are calculated independently according to certain probabilities. It runs all those calculations, and provides output\\

\textbf{Why will running the simulations on a GPU improve the performance?}\\
GPU's contain a large amount of cores that can perform calculations much more quickly than a CPU if the problem is well-suited to parallelization. GEANT-4 runs relatively simple calculations on millions of particles, and each particle is completely independent of the others. This is exactly that sort of well-suited problem, and stands to see large performance gains.\\

\textbf{Where can I find more information about GEANT-4?}\\
Cern has an entire website full of information for GEANT-4.\\ geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/index.shtml\\

\textbf{Helpful Pages:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Download page for Geant4 source code as well as Data files\\ geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/download.shtml
\item Getting Started\\ geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/gettingstarted.shtml
\item Installation Guide for geant4 (does not include CUDA)\\ geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/index.html
