\subsection{Purpose of Project} % Matt
\textbf{Project Background}\\
Currently running GEANT4 simulations that require many particle takes a long time to compute when run on the CPU. By running the simulation on the GPU the user should be able to see a significant speed up in computation times\\
\newline
\textbf{Goal of the project}\\
The goal of this project is to port the GEANT4 code to be able to run on the GPU.

\section{Project Constraints}

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Mandated Constraints} % Rob
There are global constraints put in place by the existing software, the stakeholders, and the structure of 4ZP6. The project must be built upon the existing GEANT4 code. The final product must be able to run any code/simulation that ran on the existing software. The software must run in parrallel on an NVIDIA GPU. Additionally, the final product needs to be completed by the end of April, 2016. If these global constraints are not met the final product is not acceptable.\\

\subsection{Naming Conventions \& Terminology} % Stuart
Throughout the document, ``the project'', ``the product'', and/or ``the software'' all refer to the modified GEANT-4 code that will include the capability to be run on a GPU. The ``existing software'' refers to the current GEANT-4 simulation toolkit.\\

Descriptions of each PUC, referenced by PUC \# are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{PUC_SimulatingParticles} The software will be used by researchers wishing to simulate large numbers of particles interactions with materials. The researcher sets simulation parameters, including the number of particles, their lifetime, and the material properties before running the simulation. On completion, the program gives back a map of where each particle travelled, so researchers can study where the particles are most probably to end up.

\subsection{New Problems} % Stuart
\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The new product will be designed as an opt-in addition to the existing product. That is, unless manually changed by the user, the program will execute identically as before, running on the CPU. The motivation for this is to ensure compatibility, as the programming environment for GPGPU programming is restricted to certain hardware. The current environment will not be affected by the changes unless the user specifically decides to use them.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
Requirement \ref{Req_EasyChange} specifies the importance of creating a simple interface for the user to enable the changes in the new system, or revert to the previous one. Changes to the code will be isolated, and only used when they are manually enabled.

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
Due to the separation of the changes and the existing product, users will not negatively respond to the changes, indeed they won't even notice them unless actively looking. To use the new product's features, users will enable them and then execute the program in an identical manner to how the existing software works (requirement \ref{Req_EasyChange}).

\subsubsection{Limitations of the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
To run the GPGPU computations, specific hardware is required (recent NVIDIA graphics card).

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}
There are a number of potential situations that could lead to the product failing. We are confident that we will be able to succeed, however we realize that there is a possibility of failure, and have outlined the potential causes below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning curve for existing GEANT-4 codebase is too steep, cannot gain adequate understanding to implement changes in time constraints
\item Porting existing algorithms to CUDA requires too much work, and we are not able to run the algorithms on a GPU within time constraints
\item The current product's interface for the specific algorithms that will be ported is not well-enough defined
\item The large models used in the simulation exceed memory limitations on the GPU, and cannot be run on existing hardware
\item Performance gains from the GPU are negligible, due to the structure of the computations
\item Numerical accuracy problems lead to different results from simulations run on the existing product vs. the new product
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs} % Stuart
All software used in the project is open-source and/or available for free. Existing hardware will be used for development, so there are no associated monetary costs.\\

We have very clear and well-defined deadlines for each deliverable, and are in full confidence that we will meet each one. The time it takes for each deliverable will be variable, but the date of completion for each is concrete, as outlined in \ref{SubSec_Tasks}.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training} % Matt
\begin{itemize}
	\item Function descriptions shall be provided for every new function in the code
	\item There shall be a thorough Read Me file accompanying the project that will explain to the user the changes as well as how to use the new functions
	\item Users who know how to use GEANT4 should be able to easily use the new functions
